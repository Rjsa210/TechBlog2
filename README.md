# TechBlog
This is Tech-Blog a full stack web application connecting an express server with a SQL database.

## Use
A user can create a user id and password and log into the website, if logged in they can create new blog posts and view blog posts by other users, as well as delete their own posts from their dashboard.

### Issues 
Unfortunately I was not able to acheive full functionality on this homework assignment, 
with our second project coming due, and the sheer size of this assignment I was not able to implement comments, or updates.
